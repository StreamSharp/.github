# Welcome to StreamSharp

## So what is StreamSharp?
StreamSharp is a collaborative effort to bring a new modular version of the C# wrapper for Elgato Stream Deck devices. If you're developing in C#, we want to give you access to the tools you're already familiar with, and utilise them within your plugins.
